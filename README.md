# First Discord Bot
Trying out making a Discord Bot for the first time, and here is my progress.

## Dependencies
* requests
  * ```python -m pip install requests```
* discord
  * ```pip install -U discord.py```
* python-dotenv
  * ```python -m pip install python-dotenv```

It's currently still in development and not meant to be used in the public, but if you like to use the bot, here are the instructions to setting it up.

## How to use the bot yourself
* Make sure to install all the dependencies using the terminal, as well as making sure you have the latest version of Python
* Create a `.env` file in the folder
* Add the following
  * ```TOKEN=INSERT_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN```
    * To setup a Discord bot and get the token, check out this [article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/create-a-Discord-bot-with-python/) , which shows you how to get the token and also has other information on making a Discord bot.
